# How to Solve a Quadratic Equation 

### Description
A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2.

The U shaped graph of a quadratic is called a parabola.

A quadratic equation has two solutions.
Either two distinct real solutions; one double real solution or two imaginary solutions.

There are several methods you can use to solve a quadratic equation:

* Factoring,
* Completing the sqaure.
* Quadratic formula, and 
* Graphing.

#### By Factoring:
1. Put all terms on one side of the equal sign, leaving zero on the other side.
2. Factor.
3. Set each factor equal to zero.
4. Solve each of these equations.
5. Check by inserting your anser in the original equation.

#### By Completing the Square Method:
1. divid all terms by the coefficient of x^2
2. move the number term to the right side of the equation
3. complet the square on the left side of the equation and balance this by adding the same value to the right side of the equation
4. take the sqaure root on both sides of the equation
5. subtract the remainder on the left side of the equation.

#### By Quadratic Formula:
1. To use the quadratic formula, the equation must be equal to zero
2. Identify a, b, and c and plug them into the quadratic formula
3. Use the order of operatoins to simplify the quadratic formula
4. Simplify the radical, if you can
5. Reduce the problem if you can.

#### By Graphig:
1. assign variables a, b, and  c. from the equation
2. chech the parabola if it opens upwards or downwards.
    - if a>0 then the parabola opens upwards (U-shaped)
    - if a < 0 the the paraboa opens downwards (N-shaped)
3. find the vertex
    - find the x-coordinate of the minimum point
    - substitute the x-value into the quadratic function (the y expression), to get the y-coordinate.
    - the coordinate (x,y) is the vertex.
4. find the coordinates of the y-intercept by substitutin gx = 0 in the expression.
5. find the coordinates of the x-intercept by substituting y=0 in the expression and solve the quadratic equation
